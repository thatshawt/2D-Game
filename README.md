# 2D-Game
Made this for a java class in college.

This is basically a chatting "game". You move around and chat with other users.

## Controls
You use WASD keys to move on a keyboard.

Also, if you have a ps4 controller you can use the arrow keys to move.

## Client Usage:
First argument is ip you want to connect to, second is the port.

```java -jar GameClient.jar 123.456.789.123 25565```

## Server Usage:
First argument is the port to listen on.

```java -jar GameServer.jar 25565```
